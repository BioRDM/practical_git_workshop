# Basics of git and github

## What is a git repository?

- A folder
- A `.git` folder that contains all the file history
- Changes are not recorded in real time, only by "committing" files (= adding changes to history)
- Each commit records a "diff", i.e. what has changed between the previous and current version
- Each commit is identified by a unique "hash" (randomly generated), e.g. `87c0c975daf0643d59a01222b312662d347e0bfa`
  - Shown on github as the first 7 characters for readability: `87c0c97`

## Why not make a "google docs" for code?

- Google docs is data sharing without data management
- Using Github to share code requires extra work (at least initially)
- The process makes the user decide...
  - *What* they share (which files)
  - *When* they share (working on files locally and pushing them when ready)
  - *Why* they share (for other people to use the code, to work on new developments...)

## Working with git - workflow

![](./figures/git_principle.svg)

## How to

- Create repository on Github
- Copy link
- Clone (command line, Github desktop, Rstudio?)
- Add some code files to the repository
  - Notice they appear in the RStudio git tracking window
- Stage the newly added files
- Commit (with a message)
- Push
  - Committed files are now on Github

## The Readme file

A *practical* overview of the repository, in **markdown** format

- What can be found in here?
- What's the purpose of the code
  - If possible, describe inputs and outputs
- How to use the code
  - Which scripts to run
- Who are the authors and how to contact them?

Edit your own Readme file!

<!-- Have a quick look: file history browsing in Github (show an example with more commits in nocturn repo) -->

## git tips

- `.gitignore` - list file names that should not be tracked
  - Use wildcards, e.g. `*.docx` ignores all .docx files

## Branches

<!-- Explain principle here with a figure -->

## Branches in practice

- Create a new branch "dev" in your repository
- Make some changes, commit
- Switch between branches locally
- Have a look at the two branches in Github
- Checkout the dev branch
- Next steps later

## Short break

<!-- 5 min break, I'm around for troubleshooting and questions -->

# Good coding practices

## Code modularity

<!-- How does it help, how is it achieved -->
<!-- Would be great if I had a minimal example of a short, hard to understand script (with repetitions?) that can be split into functions... -->

- Makes code more "human-readable"

## How to create a function

- A "processing unit" with clear inputs and outputs
- Can be described simply with a verb + a noun (e.g. "load_data", "set_ema_period")
- In general shorter is better, but don't worry too much about it
- Sometimes very short (1 line!) - worth it if it makes it easy to do a precise action rather than have to copy/paste complicated code

```{.r}
# In here, add a simple but *meaningful* example, with input(s) and returned outputs (don't bother with implicit return)
```

## Splitting code between different files

<!-- How to `source()` files; how to decide which function goes where (i.e. project structure) -->

## Documenting code

<!-- Show examples of each, with *good*/*bad* comparisons where needed -->

- If commenting inside the code, focus on *why* rather than *what*
- Docstrings
  - *Optional*
  - Use to document functions that are important and/or might be used by other people

## Your time to work...

Make your code more modular by creating functions and organising it in different files.

## Short break

<!-- 5 min break, I'm around for troubleshooting and questions -->

# GitHub functionalities

## Time to make your first pull request (to yourself)

On github, create a pull request to merge dev into main.

<!-- Here let people do a "no-conflict" merge on their repo -->

## When merges are more complicated

<!-- Do a live demo on my repo where I change the same file in main and dev, and solve the merge conflict -->

## Issues

- Like a centralised to-do list
- Keep track of things to do together
  - When there are multiple users, it's also useful for them to know which bugs have already been reported
- Each issue gets its own discussion feed
- How to close an issue via commit (fixes #1)
- Don't be scared of issues! Code is never perfect, there will always be bugs
  - Foster a culture of openness

## Github is not the only way

- Github doesn't own git!
- Any other website can provide similar functionalities
- Examples: Gitlab, codeberg, forgejo...
- ...including the Uni's own gitlab instance! (IT resilience)
